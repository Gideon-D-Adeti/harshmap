# HashMap and HashSet

This project implements a HashMap and HashSet data structures in JavaScript.

## Introduction

A HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing fast retrieval of values based on keys. A HashSet is similar to a HashMap, but it only contains keys without associated values. These data structures are commonly used in programming for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

This project provides JavaScript implementations of HashMap and HashSet classes, along with methods to interact with these data structures.

## Features

- Implementation of HashMap and HashSet classes
- Key-value mapping in HashMap
- Unique key storage in HashSet
- Methods for setting, getting, and removing elements
- Error handling for invalid input
- Efficient resizing of internal storage

This project was built as part of my web development journey on [The Odin Project.](https://theodinproject.com)
